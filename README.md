This project is under active development and currently provides both a **Desktop version** and a **Web service version**.

The `multi-user` branch adds an online-only, single-process Web service with isolated accounts and shared source workers. See the [deployment guide](./docs/multi-user.md), [development guide](./docs/single-process-development.md), and [memory measurements](./docs/single-process-memory-results.md) (Chinese). Local libraries and WebDAV remain available in the original desktop and single-user modes.

## Features
